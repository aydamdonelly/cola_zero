# My Literature Review Roadmap: COLA ZERO 🚀

### **PHASE 1: GROUNDWORK & PREPARATION** 🎯

This phase is about building a solid foundation *before* you start the main search.

1.  **Derive Key Topics**
    * I'll start by listing the core concepts from my problem statement:
        * Post-training quantization (PTQ)
        * Calibration data selection & sampling
        * Zero-shot & Lightweight methods
        * Quantized LLM evaluation (Perplexity)
        * Text-based feature analysis

2.  **Conduct an Initial Pilot Search**
    * I'll do a quick, informal search on Google Scholar and arXiv with my broadest keywords ("post-training quantization calibration").
    * **Goal:** Find 2-3 highly-cited "seed papers" and get a feel for the common terminology.

### **PHASE 2: BROAD SEARCH & REFINEMENT (The "Abstract Phase")** 🔍

This phase is about casting a wide net efficiently to map the landscape and refine my search tools.

1.  **Systematic Broad Search**
    * Using my initial keywords, I'll search across my target databases:
        * Google Scholar, arXiv, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ACL Anthology.

2.  **Screen Abstracts & Collect Keywords**
    * For the results, I'll read only the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion**.
    * As I screen, I'll build a list of new, specific keywords, synonyms, and related concepts (e.g., "calibration set selection," "activation statistics," "KL-divergence").

3.  **Create Concept Matrix v1.0**
    * I will synthesize the findings from the abstracts into the first version of my concept matrix. It will be concept-centric from the start.

| Article | Sampling Method | Core Principle | Evaluation Metric | Overhead/Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Paper A | Random | Statistical representation | PPL, Accuracy | **Zero** |
| Paper C | Activation-Based | Match activation distributions | PPL, KL-Divergence | **High** |

### **PHASE 3: DEEP DIVE & SYNTHESIS (The "Full Text Phase")** 💡

Now, with a refined keyword list and a set of promising papers, I will go deep to ensure complete coverage.

1.  **Full-Text Reading & Citation Chaining**
    * I'll read the full text of the papers that passed the abstract screening.
    * Crucially, I will perform **forward-backward searching** from these key articles:
        * **Backward:** I'll check their reference lists for foundational work I missed.
        * **Forward:** I'll use Google Scholar's "Cited by" feature to find newer work that builds on them.

2.  **Populate and Evolve the Concept Matrix**
    * As I read, I will fill in the matrix with much more detail, adding columns like "Key Limitation" or "Dataset Used." This matrix becomes my primary tool for analyzing the field and identifying the exact research gap for COLA ZERO.

3.  **Map Key Venues**
    * Throughout this process, I will finalize my list of the most important journals and conferences where this research is published. This demonstrates my awareness of the academic community.
        * **Conferences:** ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, ACL
        * **Journals:** TACL, TNNLS, Frontiers in AI, TIST

### **PHASE 4: WRITING THE CHAPTER** ✍️

With my synthesis complete, I'll write the review.

1.  **Start with Methodology**
    * I'll begin the chapter by transparently describing this entire process: my search terms, databases, and inclusion/exclusion criteria.

2.  **Write the Narrative**
    * I will use my **concept matrix** to structure the story. Instead of "Author A did this...", I'll write sections like "1. Activation-Based Sampling Methods" and "2. Lightweight Text-Based Approaches," comparing and contrasting the papers within each theme.

3.  **Highlight the Gap for COLA ZERO**
    * The review will logically conclude by summarizing the state of the art and using my analysis to clearly show the gap: the need for a **zero-cost, stable, and effective calibration data selection framework**. This directly motivates my own work.

This structured process ensures my literature review is systematic, comprehensive, and analytical—setting me up for the excellent mark.
